Footnotes
 
1. When deleting an inbox we keep a record of the address so the inbox is not reissued and assigned to someone else. When an account is deleted we disown the inbox so that we are unable to deduce who created the inbox, the only thing we know is that the inbox once existed.
 
2. Inboxen doesn't delete accounts immediately but instead puts them on a queue which is processed when we're able.
